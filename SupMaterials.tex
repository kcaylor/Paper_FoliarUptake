The blue dashed vertical lines mark the days of collection: the initial leaf was collected on day 0, leaves from the dew treatment were collected on days 12 and 21 and leaves from the control were collected on days 14 and 21. Red horizontal arrows indicate days when the leaves most likely experienced natural dew deposition because of the local air temperature and relative humidity under the sheltered area. The collection of the first control leaf happened after a series of small rain events and four nights of natural dew formation.}\label{dewpoint}
